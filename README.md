# StormWatchers
This StormWatchers is a Minecraft modpack that adds realistic weather effects, like snowstorms and tornadoes. With Weather2 as the main feature, it keeps the game lightweight while still feeling like vanilla Minecraft. You can explore improved landscapes with better visuals from integrated shaders, all while facing new challenges from the changing weather.
